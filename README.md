# MetaCashback

## 🏆 Overview

MetaCashback is a revolutionary system that allows users to earn cashback in USDC for their purchases with the MetaMask Card. Users can increase their cashback percentage by participating in staking or locking funds in DeFi protocols.

> 💡 **The more a user interacts with DeFi, the greater the rewards they receive.**

## 🚀 User Flow

1. **Purchase with MetaMask Card** — The user pays with the card at any merchant.
2. **Base Cashback** — Receives an initial refund in USDC (example: 1%).
3. **Cashback Increase via Staking** — If the user locks USDC in a DeFi pool, their cashback can rise to 2%, 3%, or more, depending on the amount locked.
4. **Automatic Conversion with LI.FI SDK** — The system uses LI.FI to move rewards across chains and ensure efficient liquidity.
5. **Automated Wallet Payment** — Accumulated rewards are credited directly to the user's MetaMask wallet.

## 🎯 Cashback Levels

Cashback increases according to the user's participation in DeFi:

| Level | Amount Locked | Cashback | Benefits |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------|
| 🔰 **Explorer** | $0 - $100 | 1% | Basic cashback |
